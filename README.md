# spack-supernemo
WIP Spack Package Repository for SuperNEMO Software

## Status
- Basics tests run on macOS Mojave
- Requires testing on supported Linux systems
- *Also* needs configs

## Notes
- Can get a runtime environment setup with `spack load falaise`, likely
  a development one with `spack load -r falaise`.
  - NB: needs purge of `DYLD_*` on macOS at the moment
